# Vercel Deployment Failure Webhook Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

A complete webhook system that automatically creates GitHub issues when Vercel production deployments fail.

## Key Components

### 1. Webhook Endpoint (`/api/vercel-webhook`)

- **Location**: `src/app/api/vercel-webhook/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Receives Vercel deployment notifications and creates GitHub issues for production failures
- **Features**:
  - Filters for production-only deployment failures
  - Creates detailed GitHub issues with error information
  - Includes deployment links and debugging information
  - Proper error handling and logging

### 2. Environment Configuration

- **File**: `.env.example`
- **Variables**:
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Personal access token for GitHub API
  - `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER`: Repository owner (mcclowes)
  - `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME`: Repository name (recursive-site)

### 3. Documentation

- **File**: `docs/VERCEL_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Complete setup instructions
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Vercel webhook configuration steps
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security considerations

### 4. Testing Tools

- **File**: `scripts/test-webhook.js`
- **Purpose**: Local testing of the webhook endpoint
- **Usage**: `node scripts/test-webhook.js`

## How it works

1. **Webhook Trigger**: Vercel sends POST requests to `/api/vercel-webhook` on deployment events
2. **Event Filtering**: Only processes deployment events that are:
   - Type: `deployment`
   - Target: `production`
   - State: `ERROR`
3. **Issue Creation**: Creates GitHub issues with:
   - Deployment details (ID, URL, timestamp)
   - Error information (code, message)
   - Debugging links (Vercel dashboard, deployment logs)
   - Automatic labels: `deployment-failure`, `production`, `automated`, `urgent`

## Testing Results

The webhook endpoint was successfully tested with:

- ✅ Production deployment failures (creates issues when token is available)
- ✅ Successful deployments (ignores with proper message)
- ✅ Preview/branch deployments (ignores with proper message)
- ✅ Non-deployment events (ignores with proper message)

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Set up GitHub token in production environment
2. **Vercel Configuration**: Configure webhook in Vercel project settings
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for created issues when deployments fail

## Security Considerations

- The webhook endpoint is public but only creates issues for valid deployment failures
- GitHub token requires minimal permissions (repo scope)
- Consider adding webhook signature verification for additional security

The implementation is complete and ready for production deployment.
